First Robitics Code Repository
===============================
Branches
--------
- master: contains the mainline development code (usually stable)
- event-driver: [MERGED] contains the transition code to an event-driven paradigm.  This will help us write maintainable code and develop autonomous code on top of a state machine. (unstable)
- newbot-conversion: [MERGED] branch for porting all code over to the final bot design (unstable)

Tags
--------
- event-driver-a1: "Event Driver Alpha 1" - the first "working" revision of the event interface with only controller events.  This is meant to be an initial demo and skeleton for 'pollEvent().' [unstable]
- event-driver-a2: "Event Driver Alpha 2" - just event-driver-a1 with bugfixes.  The featureset is much more stable.  No new features. [unstable]
- event-driver-a3: "Event Driver Alpha 3" - final engine and tankdrive code before merge into master [stable]
- legacy-final: "Final Legacy Tag" - the point right before a massive recoding started
